# Development todo

## General

* Next button is broken in detail view, probably obscured b/c of z-index settings
* Back button is broken on detail view
* Implement icons tab bar (get icons from old design file in Sketch? Or from e-mails to underlined?)
* Add Apple touch icon
* Animate routes, like in Clank https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2n1Ue7N1BCc

## Detail

* Implement nice transition on drag on detail page
* Filter the data on detail page so we only show the items that have data when doing next/prev
* Add page titles for every character on detail page

## Quiz

* Do a proper segmented control component that is based on a radio button internally for quiz settings
