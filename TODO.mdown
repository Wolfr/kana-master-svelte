# Development todo

## General

* Implement dark mode
* Make favicon in browser simply the book without the background - Clean up the design file in Figma
* If you click the sound enabled icon, you should get a toast: Sound enabled
* Would be nice: Animate routes, like in Clank https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2n1Ue7N1BCc

## Detail

* Make the back button more like a ghost button
* Implement a way to go to the next item by swiping

## Quiz actual
 
* Implement "Quiz done! You got 4 out of 5 right."
* Fix autofocus on the quiz actual; maybe try instead of autofocus property to focus via JS function after {advance}
* Center the view of the quiz actual
* The quiz boxes should already be there to give you a view of your progress

## Results
